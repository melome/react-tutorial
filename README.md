# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My first react App

This app was created from studying the basics of react using class component.

It's a simple app that renders users in a table


##API
I used open-sourced API for this project. It's called [Random User](https://api.randomuser.me/).
